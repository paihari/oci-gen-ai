## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. It leverages a database of information to enhance the generative capabilities of AI, leading to better performance in tasks such as question answering and content generation.
